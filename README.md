Hello everyone!
Welcome to this small file, which pretty much covers what a beginner might need for learning:

2. Pandas
3. Seaborn

These three are very powerful packages, which help in data analysis and visualisation.
Go through the ipynb file attached and run it to see the plots and visualisations.
